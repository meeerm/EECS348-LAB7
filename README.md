Practice One: HTML EECS Profiles (10 points)
Make a profile page that is styled with CSS. Have fun with this. In your profile, you need to
include your name, a photo, and contact info and showcase anything good for your professional
career, e.g., courses, projects, and work experience... You could also use JS and PHP in this
practice. At the same time, you must include at least one link and video.

 Practice Two: CSS Font Control (10 points)
Create a web page that has a paragraph with some dummy text. Near the paragraph, have a
text field to accept the following values: red/green/blue values for the paragraph and
red/green/blue values for the border. You also need to control the width of the border.

Practice Three: JavaScript Password Verification (10 points)
Create a JavaScript program that allows the user to enter a password two times to verify them.
If the password is not at least eight characters long or if two passwords are different, alert the
user. Otherwise, tell the user that two passwords are matched.

Practice Four: Create a PHP program that receives a number and displays a multiplication table from 1 to the
number. You also need to print the row and column indexes in the table.
